This homework contains collaborative work with some of the classmates (Chenxi Cui, Xinge Zhong, and Xianbo Gao). However, the group serves as a way for brainstorming of ideas and bug-fixing. Everyone has done the homework on his/her own.

# Assignment 1
Plots of sample sizes against sample means have been plotted for five different distribution random samples with the same mean. The resulting plots illustrate the central limit theorem.

# Assignment 2
