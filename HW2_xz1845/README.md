## Assignment 1: tracking each vehicle for a line
See show_bus_locations_xz1845.py for the script. The script requires two inputs: The JSON API key from the mta, and the bus line number.
The script output the locations of each of the buses by latitude and longitude.

## Assignment 2:
See get_bus_info_xz1845.py for the script. It is similar with the assignment 1 solution. In addition, it requires another input for the output csv file name.
The output will be a csv file with latitude, longitude, stop name and stop status for each of the buses of a paricular bus line.

## Assignment 3:
See HW2_3_xz1845.ipynb for solution. The dataset I chose is the reservoir water level changes over period. Two of the columns have been plotted with scatters.

## Extra Credit:
See HW2_Extra_Credit_xz1845.ipynb for solution. It is quite similar with assignment 3 and it used the same dataset. A Datetime column has been incorprated and reformatted for the time series plot.
