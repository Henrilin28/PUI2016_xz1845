# Assignment 1
Analyzed the age distrbution of citi-bikers with Gaussian and Rayleigh Distribution models. Used K-S test and A-D test for the Gaussian model, and used K-S test and Chi-square test for the Rayleigh Model. 

# Assignment 2
Used linear regression (both numerical and analytical solution) to analyze the income gender bias problem. Various plots have been made to visualize the problem.

# Assignment 3

Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Null hypothesis:
People who have diets (Test sample) lose less or equal amount of fat than those do exercise instead (Control sample) on average.
$A_test \leq A_control$, $\alpha = 0.05$
where $A$ is average fat loss. Significance level = 0.05.


Do American trust the president?
POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

Null hypothesis: The percentage of Americans who trusted Bill Clinton was less than the percentage of Americans who distrusted him. Significance level = 0.05.
$P_trust < P_distrust$, $\alpha = 0.05$


Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

Null hypothesis: The average cessation rate for smokers who used nicotine pathes is less than or equal to the average cessation rate for smokers who used placebo pathes. Significance level = 0.05.

$C_nicotine \leq C_placebo$, $\alpha = 0.05$
Where C is the average cessation rate in a sample.


Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

Null hypothesis: The IQ development of children (at the age range of 1 to 4 years old) whose mothers were smoking during their pregnancy is the same or faster than those whose mothers didn't smoke during pregnancy on average. Significance level = 0.05.

$d{IQ_{smoke}}/d{age} \geq d{IQ_{nonsmoke}}/d{age}$, $\alpha = 0.05$
